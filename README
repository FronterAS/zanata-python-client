You can manually specify the location of user configuration file by command line option '--user-config',

For each project, you also have to write a project-specific configuration file named flies.xml, which is also as same as flies.xml used by maven client, you could also take a reference from http://code.google.com/p/flies/wiki/ClientConfiguration. You can set the path of project configuration file by command line option '--project-config'.

You can also point the URL of server by command line opition '--url'. There is also command line option '--username' for user name and command line option '--apikey' for api key of user. 

Command List:

Name: /usr/bin/flies

Basic Usage: flies COMMAND [ARGS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]

Listing / Querying for Projects

$ flies list

Creating a project

$ flies project create {project_id} --project-name={projec_name} --project-desc={project_description}

Create a Project Version

$ flies version create {version_id} --project-id={project_id} --version-name={version_name} --version-desc={version_description}

Query for information of a project

$ flies project info --project-id={project_id}

$ flies publican push --project-id={project_id} --project-version={iteration_id} [documentName..]

Without indicate the documentName, 'publican push' command will push all the template files under the template folder to Flies server. You can specify the path of template folder by command line option, if you don't provide such info, the command will try to locate template folder in current path

$ flies publican push --project-id={project_id} --project-version={iteration_id} --srcDir={template_folder}

$ flies publican push --project-id={project_id} --project-version={iteration_id} 

Or you can simply running below command in a folder contain template folder with flies.xml, command will load all the info from configuration file:

$ flies publican push 

You can enable 'importPo' option, then related translation (po files) will be pushed to flies server at the same time. you need to specify the parent folder that contain all the translation by 'transDir' command line option. By default, command will read the language info from project configuration file 'flies.xml', or you can specify the language that you want to push to the flies server by 'lang' option

$ flies publican push --importPo --tranDir={path of parent folder contains locale folders} --lang=lang1,lang2,..

You could also enable 'copyTrans' option, then the server will try to find closest equivalent translation from oter versions in the same project and copy to version you specified.

$ flies publican push --copyTrans

Command will read the language info from project configuration file 'flies.xml', or you can specify the language that you want to pull from the flies server by 'lang' option

$ flies publican pull --project-id={project_id} --project-version={iteration_id} --lang=lang1,lang2,.. --dstDir={output_folder} 

$ flies publican pull --project-id={project_id} --project-version={iteration_id} --lang=lang1,lang2,..

you can also simply running below command in a folder contain flies.xml, command will load all the info from configuration file:
